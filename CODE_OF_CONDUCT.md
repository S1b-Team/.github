# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

S1BGr0up is committed to fostering an open, welcoming, and ethical community focused on advancing cybersecurity knowledge and capabilities. We pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of experience level, background, or identity.

## Hacker Ethics

We follow the principles of ethical hacking:

### The Hacker Code

1. **Access to computers should be unlimited and total** - in authorized environments only
2. **All information should be free** - while respecting privacy and legal boundaries
3. **Mistrust authority – promote decentralization** - through education and open source
4. **Hackers should be judged by their hacking** - not by demographics or credentials
5. **You can create art and beauty on a computer** - and share it responsibly
6. **Computers can change your life for the better** - when used ethically

## Our Standards

### ✅ Positive Behavior

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what's best for the community

### ❌ Unacceptable Behavior

## Ethical Security Research

All community members must:

- **Follow responsible disclosure** for vulnerability findings
- **Use tools legally** and only in controlled environments

# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

S1BGr0up takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in any of our tools or projects, we appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly.

### üîí Responsible Disclosure Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Contact us privately** through one of these channels:
   - GitHub Security Advisories (preferred for this repository)
   - Encrypted email to the project lead (PGP key available on request)
   - Direct message to [@ind4skylivey](https://github.com/ind4skylivey)

### üìã What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish?
- **Affected versions**: Which versions are vulnerable?
- **Reproduction steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands (if safe to share)
- **Suggested fix**: If you have remediation ideas
- **Your details**: How you'd like to be credited (or anonymous)

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

We are committed to responding promptly:

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 48 hours | Initial acknowledgment of report |
| 7 days | Preliminary assessment and validation |
| 30-90 days | Fix development and release (varies by severity) |

Critical vulnerabilities will be prioritized and addressed as quickly as possible.

### üéØ Severity Levels

We use the following severity classification:

#### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation to root/admin
- Authentication bypass
- Data exfiltration vulnerabilities
- OPSEC compromise

#### High
- Information disclosure of sensitive data
- Cross-site scripting (if applicable)
- SQL injection (if applicable)
- Denial of service affecting core functionality

#### Medium
- Limited information disclosure
- Denial of service with limited impact
- Security misconfigurations

#### Low
- Minor security concerns
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without clear exploit path

### üèÜ Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers:

- **Public acknowledgment** in release notes and SECURITY.md (if desired)
- **Credit in commits** related to the fix
- **Hall of Fame** section (coming soon)
- **Anonymous option** available for those who prefer it

### ‚úÖ Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers:

- Good faith security research is appreciated
- We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
  - Follow responsible disclosure practices
  - Do not access or modify data beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
  - Do not impact other users or systems
  - Do not publicly disclose the issue before it's fixed

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

When using our tools:

- Always obtain proper authorization before security testing
- Use tools only in controlled, authorized environments
- Keep tools updated to the latest versions
- Review code before use in production engagements

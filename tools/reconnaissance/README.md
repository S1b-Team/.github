# Reconnaissance Tools

> Information gathering and enumeration tools for the reconnaissance phase of Red Team operations.

## 📋 Overview

This directory contains tools for passive and active reconnaissance, OSINT gathering, network enumeration, and attack surface mapping. These tools are designed to gather maximum intelligence with minimal footprint.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Reconnaissance is the first phase of any Red Team engagement. The goal is to:
- Identify target assets and infrastructure
- Map attack surface
- Discover potential vulnerabilities
- Gather intelligence for planning attacks
- Maintain OPSEC during information gathering

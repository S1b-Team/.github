## üîÑ Engagement Phases

### Phase 1: Planning & Reconnaissance

**Objective**: Gather intelligence about the target without direct interaction.

**Activities**:

**MITRE ATT&CK Tactics**:
- Reconnaissance (TA0043)

**Key Deliverables**:
- Scope document with clear boundaries
- Asset inventory
- OSINT report
- Attack vectors identified

**Tools Category**:
```
tools/reconnaissance/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Passive information gathering
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ OSINT automation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Attack surface mapping
```

---

### Phase 2: Initial Access

**Objective**: Gain initial foothold in the target environment.

**Activities**:
- Active reconnaissance and enumeration
- Vulnerability identification
- Exploit development or adaptation
- Social engineering (if in scope)
- Credential harvesting

**MITRE ATT&CK Tactics**:
- Initial Access (TA0001)
- Execution (TA0002)

**Common Techniques**:

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Enumeration scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Privilege escalation tools
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Kernel exploits
```

---

### Phase 4: Persistence

**Objective**: Maintain access to the compromised environment.

**Activities**:

- Create additional accounts
- Schedule tasks
- Modify system configurations

**MITRE ATT&CK Tactics**:
- Persistence (TA0003)

**Common Techniques**:

- Implant Container Image (T1525)

**Tools Category**:
```
tools/persistence/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Backdoor implementations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Persistence mechanisms
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Rootkits (for research)
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Ethics Note**: Always remove persistence mechanisms after engagement completion.

---

### Phase 5: Defense Evasion

**Objective**: Avoid detection by security controls.

**Activities**:
- Log manipulation
- Process hiding
- Traffic obfuscation
- Anti-forensics techniques

**MITRE ATT&CK Tactics**:

**Common Techniques**:
- Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)
- Indicator Removal on Host (T1070)
- Masquerading (T1036)
- Process Injection (T1055)

**Tools Category**:
```
tools/evasion/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Obfuscation tools
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Log cleaners
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Traffic tunneling
```

---

### Phase 6: Lateral Movement

**Objective**: Move through the network to reach additional targets.

**Activities**:
- Network enumeration
- Credential dumping
- Remote exploitation
- Pivot through compromised hosts

**MITRE ATT&CK Tactics**:
- Lateral Movement (TA0008)
- Discovery (TA0007)

**Common Techniques**:
- Remote Services (T1021)
- Use Alternate Authentication Material (T1550)
- Internal Spearphishing (T1534)

---

### Phase 7: Collection & Exfiltration

**Objective**: Gather and extract target data (simulation only).

**Activities**:
- Identify sensitive data
- Stage data for extraction
- Document findings
- Create proof of concept

**MITRE ATT&CK Tactics**:
- Collection (TA0009)
- Exfiltration (TA0010)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical**: In real engagements, NEVER exfiltrate actual sensitive data. Use dummy files or screenshots as proof.

---

### Phase 8: Reporting & Remediation

**Objective**: Document findings and assist with remediation.

**Activities**:
- Compile comprehensive report
- Risk assessment and prioritization
- Remediation recommendations
- Debrief with client
- Clean up (remove tools, backdoors, accounts)

**Deliverables**:
- Executive summary
- Technical report with evidence
- Remediation roadmap
- Lessons learned

   - Emergency stop protocols

3. **Activity Logs**
   - Timestamp of every action
   - Commands executed
   - Tools used
   - Results obtained

4. **Evidence Collection**
   - Screenshots of critical findings
   - Proof-of-concept code
   - Network captures (sanitized)
   - Credential dumps (hashed)

5. **Clean-up Verification**
   - Tools removed
   - Accounts deleted
   - Persistence mechanisms removed
   - System state restored

## üîí OPSEC Considerations

### Operational Security Best Practices

#### 1. **Infrastructure Security**
- Use dedicated infrastructure for operations
- Implement proper network segmentation
- Encrypt all C2 communications
- Use VPNs and proxies to obfuscate source

#### 2. **Tool Security**
- No hardcoded credentials in tools
- Sanitize logs and output files
- Use secure communication channels
- Implement anti-forensics by default

#### 3. **Data Handling**
- Never store real credentials in plain text
- Encrypt sensitive engagement data
- Secure deletion of temporary files
- Follow data retention policies

#### 4. **Communication Security**
- Use encrypted channels (PGP, Signal)
- Avoid discussing sensitive details publicly
- Protect client confidentiality
- Follow NDA requirements

#### 5. **Personal OPSEC**
- Separate personal and professional identities
- Use anonymous accounts when necessary
- Protect team member identities
- Follow social media guidelines

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal & Ethical Disclaimer

**CRITICAL**: All Red Team activities must be:
- ‚úÖ Authorized in writing before starting

- ‚úÖ Conducted with professional ethics
- ‚úÖ Properly documented and reported

**NEVER** conduct unauthorized security testing. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.
